### Overview

This is is the code repo behind this website.

It started of as a side project to get to grips with react, from a platform to test out some web dev technolgies, to a portfolio website!

I still use it occasionaly to try out new bits and piees, or try my hand at implementing something I thought looked cool on another website

### How it works

I built the website with **React.js** using **Next.js**. I used **Tailwind** to help with the styling of the website, as this is well supported by next.js.



### My Synth

Audio engineering has always been a bit of an intrest of mine. The synth was a result of some messing around with the Web AUdio API and tones.js. Please feel free to have a go!


### Inspiration

Hugely inspired by the layout of the blog [nan.fyi](https://www.nan.fyi). A great article on SVGs proved very influential!

Also took some inpiration from the sites behind [tone.js](https://tonejs.github.io/) and [Fractured Air](https://fracturedair.wordpress.com/), to name but a few!
